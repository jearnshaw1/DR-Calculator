//TO DO
/*filter coefficients for different sampling rates need calculated
in order to implement 1st and 2nd filters of the loudness
algorithm
The algorithm's implementation is currently split into multiple functions:
preconditiong such as filtering etc.
short-term loudness windowing
integrated dynamic range calculation
